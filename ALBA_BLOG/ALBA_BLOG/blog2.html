     <h1>Beginner Tips for LEGO Creators</h1>
     <h2>1. Research Thoroughly – Don’t Be a Brickhead</h2>
     <p>Before you start splurging, take a moment to do some detective work. 
        You don’t want to end up with a castle when you were aiming for a spaceship! 
        This hobby can add up quickly, 
        be sure you’re going to be happy with your purchase.</p>

     <h2>2. Set a Budget – Don’t Let LEGO Rob Your Piggy Bank</h2>
     <p>Sure, LEGO sets are tempting, 
        but your bank account will thank you later if you set a budget. 
        Otherwise, you might end up trading your car for a Millennium Falcon. 
        Or, if you are after a Millennium Falcon, make it a savings goal. 
        The satisfaction once you reach your target will be amazing!</p>

     <h2>3. Focus on Themes – Don’t Get Lost in a LEGO Labyrinth</h2>
     <p>With so many themes to choose from, it’s easy to feel like a kid in a candy store. 
        But remember, it’s better to master one theme than to dabble 
        in everything like a LEGO buffet. </p>

     <h2>4. Stay Updated – Don’t Let LEGO Surprises Catch You Off Guard</h2>
     <p>LEGO announcements can be as surprising as finding a missing brick in your carpet. 
        Stay updated to avoid the disappointment of missing out on that limited edition set. 
        Keep an eye on the LEGO.com Coming Soon page for updates. </p>

     <h2>5. Quality Over Quantity – Don’t Build a LEGO Tower of Babel</h2>
     <p>It’s tempting to amass a tower of LEGO sets taller than Mount Everest, but remember, 
        it’s quality over quantity. 
        Your collection will thank you, and so will your storage space! </p>
